Static Page WebRoot server
----------
This is a deployable server that uses the static pages (HTML and CSS only) (no JavaScript). 

Due to no JavaScript the page is re-loaded every time you click on any link or button. 

No JavaScript is for users that doesn't trust the server. And it made for specially for Tor
users to transfer the files and folder or make a secure folder on tor by its self using 
self hosting or on a server on tor network.

And recommend for that need a secure folder service on tor and need to share multiple files 
on Tor network.
